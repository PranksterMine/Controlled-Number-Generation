# Controlled-Number-Generation
I made this project as a test of some Python basics I've learned. It doesn't serve much purpose, and I don't see it being practical.

The project uses loops and a break command to output the numbers zero through 199,999. It's very simplistic and not designed to be more than a test.

This project has an MIT license attached.
